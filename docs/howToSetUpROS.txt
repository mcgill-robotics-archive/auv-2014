How to set up ROS
Last Edited Dec 11, 2013, Bei Liu

Install ROS following Installation Guide and <>skip part 1.6:
	http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu
	
Pull the McGill_RoboSub_2014 from github if you have not done so:
	in terminal run the following command:
		sudo apt-get install git
		cd ~
		mkdir McGill_RoboSub_2014
		cd McGill_RoboSub_2014
		git init
		git remote add origin "https://github.com/McGill-Robotics/McGill_RoboSub_2014.git" 
		git pull origin master
		
	
Run the Symlink.sh in the dotfiles folder.
	This will copy configuration file for tmux and vim; copy roboticrc to your home directory and source it in .bashrc.  (You don't to read the rest if you don't want to)
	The roboticrc will have several functions: 
		add some alias that are somewhat useful (ask Anass), you can add your own alias to this list; 
		source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash so you can use ros command directly on any new terminal windows; 
		source /catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash, this enables you to use the package that we have created (if you get error on opening terminal, be sure to run catkin_make in you catkin_ws);
		export ROS_PATH and export ROS_WORKSPACE which are the ros environment variables. 
		.
