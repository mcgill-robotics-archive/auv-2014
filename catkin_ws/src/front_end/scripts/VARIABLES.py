##@package VARIABLES
#
# file grouping similar variables in classes
#since python does not have enums,
#
# also, these variables will be accessed by different python files therefore the need for a separate file
#file containing all variables shared between one or more files also contains parameters and constants used in the UI and the key mapping for the keyboard controller
